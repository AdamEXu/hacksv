## Stuff we had at Scrapyard

Ok so I am **not** actually recommending any of these items since i haven't personally tried most of them. but since they were at scrapyard, some of you have tried them. If you liked them, consider buying some to tinker yourself at home!

* [KEYESTUDIO 37 in 1 Sensor Kit for Arduino](https://amzn.to/3XmAGYa) - yes these work with esp32's, idk about the quality of these sensors but they're a hella good deal for $23.99 and it's a good variety
* [Weewooday 5 Pieces 0.96 Inch OLED Module 12864 128x64 Driver IIC I2C Serial Self-Luminous Display Board](https://amzn.to/3LZBGPy) - they are in fact displays, $12.99 for a 5 pack
* [ELEGOO 120pcs Multicolored Dupont Wire 40pin](https://amzn.to/4aeKBGM) - $5.58 and you get 120 cables total, which is cheap. you do get what you pay for since someone at scrapyard said a cable fell apart. but there's enoguh in there that this wasn't a probelm. again, not endorsing any of these products.
* [NFC ACR122U Contactless IC Card Reader Writer/USB](https://amzn.to/4ohLems) - it worked pretty well at scrapyard. nfc reader and writer. supports NFC tools app and it was programmable so yay!!
* [PNY 64GB Premier-X Class 10 U3 V30 microSDXC Flash Memory Card 5-Pack](https://amzn.to/4pvKgnx) - can never have enough microsd cards and these were the cheapest we could find that were good quality. you can probably find a better deal for black friday (but not on amazon from a quick search). def check micro center. HIGHLY RECOMMMEND MICROCENTER!!!
* [Neon Rope Lights, 16.4FT IC+RGB LED Strip Lights](https://amzn.to/44l8E36) - these look pretty cool, much slicker than cheap rgb light strips. but they aren't very bright. sufficient for indoor use, barely visible outdoors. was a prize but i misclicked in the amazon order history so i guess this goes too.
* amazon says that these amazon basics batteries are EXCLUDED from the amazon affiliate program unfortunately but still giving the link in case you want it [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MH4QM1S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MH4QM1S). not recommending these batteries, they just are the cheapest. [super cool video comparing batteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ_tGjXm0Ng) as you can see all alkaline batteries are trash
* [48pcs RGB LED WS2812B 5050 Light Board](https://amzn.to/3XOKf2b) - they are lights and they are rgb. cheaper than adafruit but probably lower quality as well.
* [Smraza 6 Pcs SG90 9G Micro Servo Motor Kit](https://amzn.to/44zrW4P) - servo motors, idk how good they are, maybe ask in the discord cuz i know one team used it (forgot which though)
* [Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor Assortment Box](https://amzn.to/44q0Ugd) - some people were exploding these at scrapyard, too lazy to link the video (dm natey to get it)
* [ELEGOO 17 Values 1% Resistor Kit Assortment](https://amzn.to/3Kg14Qz) - assortment of resistors. they worked fine afaik. AND IT HAS THE BLACK FRIDAY DEAL SO IT'S A GOOD DEAAL! /j you just save like $2
* [ELEGOO 2PCS 830 Point & 2PCS 400 Point Breadboard Kit](https://amzn.to/3LZCeF6) - they are in fact breadboards (not edible)
* [5MM LED Diode Light Assortment Kit](https://amzn.to/4afVRCN) - not rgb, only 5 colors, but cheap
* [260Pcs Micro Momentary Tactile Push Button Switch](https://amzn.to/48nZMLv) - heard these were pretty cheap but the price is also cheap
* [Digital Multimeter Tester](https://amzn.to/4ogMjuw) - multimeter (insanely cheap) wasn't used at scrapyard and was given away as a prize

## macbook air

omg guys pls buy macbook air it's 25 % off and we make a lot of money from this if you actually buy!!!!!!!

In all seriousness though 25% off is a crazy discount, that's like even more than the employee discount. It's the brand new M4 macbook air which is like the this year model, brand new, not used. apple stuff is usually never on sale

[Link to purchase Macbook Air on Amazon](https://amzn.to/48BgojW) - Currently $749.00 (genuinely crazy deal)

## airpod

apparenlty kids buy airpods these days so:

* [Apple AirPods 4](https://amzn.to/48hjKHr) - latest model for $69 is pretty good almost 50% off. no ANC though which is a big L
* [Apple AirPods 4 but WITH ANC](https://amzn.to/4pqmSYG) - $30 more gets you ANC which is very much worth it imo, still almost 50% off
* [Apple AirPods Pro 3](https://amzn.to/4isoAXm) - you do NOT need the new pro airpods unless you're buying them for the looks but like whatever i guess. not much discount mostly because just came out a month or two ago
* [Beats Studio Pro](https://amzn.to/4oeFoSH) - okay these aren't airpods but I personally use these and they're much much much better value than airpods max, audio quality is good, and it's more than 50% off so yay!!! has ANC and pairs to you apple devices like airpods (cuz apple owns beats) but if you don't own apple devices not as worth it instead get the
* [Sony WH-1000XM6](https://amzn.to/3M1xq23) - dont have these, heard good things about them though. very pricey \*gasp\* but apparently the ANC is really good idk do your own research


## Pinecil

Ok so I personally own a Pinecil and it's *really* good. Was recommended it by someone from Hack Club. To be fair, I've never used any other soldering iron, and honestly if you needed a soldering iron you probably already have one, so idk how many people are actually looking to buy this.

[Link to purchase Pinecil on Amazon](https://amzn.to/44wX98G) - Currently $39.99

## other recommends from adam

at this point i'm running out of ideas so some stuff i have on my desk right now:

i use the [GeeekPi Metal Case for Raspberry Pi 5](https://amzn.to/3KgQnwY) case for my pi, not best value but overall pretty good build quality and came with the official pi 5 active cooler thing.

btw, DO NOT BUY RASPBERRY PI FROM AMAZON. they generally have really bad prices cuz they have to factor in prime shipping. micro center has pis on sale right now, highly recommend.

my mouse of choice is [Logitech MX Anywhere 2S](https://amzn.to/4rkXc1p) it's nice and compact and works well. love it.

the controller i use for gaming is [8Bitdo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller](https://amzn.to/4p1B0ro), it's hall effect so no drift, works with switch and ios and mac so i'm satisfied

the usb c dongle i use is [Anker USB C Hub](https://amzn.to/3M0X9aY) but honestly this really depends on your use case. i mainly use it for the microsd card slot, the ethernet port, connecting to hard drives via usb a, and it charges my laptop at the same time which is nice

bought 3 of these last black friday, fire deal [Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank, 10,000mAh Wireless Portable Charger](https://amzn.to/3Km3LzU) yes it's a magsafeish (well qi + magnets not magsafe) battery bank and it's a really really good deal $29.99 and it's not one of those sketchy chinese chargers. personally never had any issues with it. the light color ones scuff pretty easily so i recommend the black one

[SABRENT 4 Port USB 3.0 Hub](https://amzn.to/3Xg9Scb) is a powered ac hub, which means that power comes in seperately from the usb port on your laptop. idk why i got a powered hub tbh, i'm only using it to connect peripherals to my pi zero 2w, so kinda overkill for this. we also had one as a prize during counterspell
