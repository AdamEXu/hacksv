## Stuff we had at Scrapyard

Ok so I am **not** actually recommending any of these items since i haven't personally tried most of them. but since they were at scrapyard, some of you have tried them. If you liked them, consider buying some to tinker yourself at home!

* [KEYESTUDIO 37 in 1 Sensor Kit for Arduino](https://amzn.to/3XmAGYa) - yes these work with esp32's, idk about the quality of these sensors but they're a hella good deal for $23.99 and it's a good variety
* [Weewooday 5 Pieces 0.96 Inch OLED Module 12864 128x64 Driver IIC I2C Serial Self-Luminous Display Board](https://amzn.to/3LZBGPy) - they are in fact displays, $12.99 for a 5 pack
* [ELEGOO 120pcs Multicolored Dupont Wire 40pin](https://amzn.to/4aeKBGM) - $5.58 and you get 120 cables total, which is cheap. you do get what you pay for since someone at scrapyard said a cable fell apart. but there's enoguh in there that this wasn't a probelm. again, not endorsing any of these products.
* [NFC ACR122U Contactless IC Card Reader Writer/USB](https://amzn.to/4ohLems) - it worked pretty well at scrapyard. nfc reader and writer. supports NFC tools app and it was programmable so yay!!
* [PNY 64GB Premier-X Class 10 U3 V30 microSDXC Flash Memory Card 5-Pack](https://amzn.to/4pvKgnx) - can never have enough microsd cards and these were the cheapest we could find that were good quality. you can probably find a better deal for black friday (but not on amazon from a quick search). def check micro center. HIGHLY RECOMMMEND MICROCENTER!!!
* [Neon Rope Lights, 16.4FT IC+RGB LED Strip Lights](https://amzn.to/44l8E36) - these look pretty cool, much slicker than cheap rgb light strips. but they aren't very bright. sufficient for indoor use, barely visible outdoors. was a prize but i misclicked in the amazon order history so i guess this goes too.
* amazon says that these amazon basics batteries are EXCLUDED from the amazon affiliate program unfortunately but still giving the link in case you want it [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MH4QM1S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MH4QM1S). not recommending these batteries, they just are the cheapest. [super cool video comparing batteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ_tGjXm0Ng) as you can see all alkaline batteries are trash
* [48pcs RGB LED WS2812B 5050 Light Board](https://amzn.to/3XOKf2b) - they are lights and they are rgb. cheaper than adafruit but probably lower quality as well.
* [Smraza 6 Pcs SG90 9G Micro Servo Motor Kit](https://amzn.to/44zrW4P) - servo motors, idk how good they are, maybe ask in the discord cuz i know one team used it (forgot which though)
* [Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor Assortment Box](https://amzn.to/44q0Ugd) - some people were exploding these at scrapyard, too lazy to link the video (dm natey to get it)
* [ELEGOO 17 Values 1% Resistor Kit Assortment](https://amzn.to/3Kg14Qz) - assortment of resistors. they worked fine afaik. AND IT HAS THE BLACK FRIDAY DEAL SO IT'S A GOOD DEAAL! /j you just save like $2
* [ELEGOO 2PCS 830 Point & 2PCS 400 Point Breadboard Kit](https://amzn.to/3LZCeF6) - they are in fact breadboards (not edible)
* [5MM LED Diode Light Assortment Kit](https://amzn.to/4afVRCN) - not rgb, only 5 colors, but cheap
* [260Pcs Micro Momentary Tactile Push Button Switch](https://amzn.to/48nZMLv) - heard these were pretty cheap but the price is also cheap
* [Digital Multimeter Tester](https://amzn.to/4ogMjuw) - multimeter (insanely cheap) wasn't used at scrapyard and was given away as a prize

## MACBOOK AIR????

Please don't buy this just because i put an affiliate link here. I know they're really good though and if you happened to be buying one this black friday or whatever (or if a family member was), pretty pretty please click link (it'll actually contribute more than $2 to our bank account!!)

In all seriousness though 25% off is a crazy discount, that's like even more than the employee discount. It's the brand new M4 macbook air which is like the this year model, brand new, not used. apple stuff is usually never on sale

in terms of the laptop itself it's really solid. if you're doing video editing or blender or stuff like that you might want to get a better machine, but tbh this is the laptop i'd recommend to most people

[Link to purchase Macbook Air on Amazon](https://amzn.to/48BgojW) - Currently $749.00 (genuinely crazy deal)

## Pinecil

Ok so I personally own a Pinecil and it's *really* good. Was recommended it by someone from Hack Club. To be fair, I've never used any other soldering iron, and honestly if you needed a soldering iron you probably already have one, so idk how many people are actually looking to buy this.

[Link to purchase Pinecil on Amazon](https://amzn.to/44wX98G) - Currently $39.99
